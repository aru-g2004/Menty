# Menty
This is the repo for Menty, a project that I worked on along with Leah and Sophia, for the ADL Appathon competition 2022. We won 2nd place overall in the competition amongst over 50 submissions. Menty is a mobile application that helps people detect mental health disorders using easy, accessible methods and gives users access to tailored help from health professionals in the industry without paying a hefty price.
